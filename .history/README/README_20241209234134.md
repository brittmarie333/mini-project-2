# Mini Project 2

This project requires me to create a **contact management system** that meets *5 requirements.* I have outlined below my process and how my contact management system works. 

### What are the requirements? 
*user interface(ui)*
*contact data storage*
*menu actions*
*user interactions*
*error handling*

### What are the expectations of this program?
Apply Python programming skills to create a functional command-line-based application that simplifies the management of your contacts. You will be able to add, edit, delete, and search for contacts, all while reinforcing your understanding of Python dictionaries, file handling, user interaction, and error handling.

### Extensions needed:
*python*
*python debugger*
*markdown checkboxes*

#### Where can I find the program?
*placeholder for link*

## Programming steps:

***User Interface (UI)***
Must create a user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) for the Contact Management System
Display a welcoming message and provide a mendu with the required choices. The

``` Example of Menu

contacts = {}

def display_menu():
    print("Welcome to the Contact Management System!")
    print("Menu:")
    print("1. Add a new contact")
    print("2. Edit an existing contact")
    print("3. Delete a contact")
    print("4. Search for a contact")
    print("5. Display all contacts")
    print("6. Export contacts to a text file")
    print("7. Import contacts from a text file")
    print("8. Quit")
```
