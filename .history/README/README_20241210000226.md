# Mini Project 2

This project requires me to create a **contact management system** that meets *5 requirements.* I have outlined below my process and how my contact management system works. 

### What are the requirements? 
*user interface(ui)*
*contact data storage*
*menu actions*
*user interactions*
*error handling*

### What are the expectations of this program?
Apply Python programming skills to create a functional command-line-based application that simplifies the management of your contacts. You will be able to add, edit, delete, and search for contacts, all while reinforcing your understanding of Python dictionaries, file handling, user interaction, and error handling.

### Extensions needed:
*python*
*python debugger*
*markdown checkboxes*

#### Where can I find the program?
*placeholder for link*

## Programming steps:

***User Interface (UI)***
Must create a user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) for the Contact Management System
Display a welcoming message and provide a mendu with the required choices. The

``` Example of Menu

contacts = {}

def display_menu():
    print("Welcome to the Contact Management System!")
    print("Menu:")
    print("1. Add a new contact")
    print("2. Edit an existing contact")
    print("3. Delete a contact")
    print("4. Search for a contact")
    print("5. Display all contacts")
    print("6. Export contacts to a text file")
    print("7. Import contacts from a text file")
    print("8. Quit")
```


***User-Friendly command-line interface (CLI) for Contact Management System***
This CLI allows users to interact with the program in a loop until finished. 
``` CLI for contact management system 
def run_cli():
    while True:
        display_menu()
        try:
            choice = int(input("Please choose 1-8: "))  
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid option, please try again.")
            continue

        if choice == 1:
            add_contact()
        elif choice == 2:
            edit_contact()
        elif choice == 3:
            delete_contact()
        elif choice == 4:
            search_contacts()
        elif choice == 5:
            display_all_contacts()
        elif choice == 6:
            export_contacts()
        elif choice == 7:
            import_contacts()
        elif choice == 8:
            print("Thank you, have a great day!")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid option, please try again.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_cli()
```


***Contact Data Storage***
I used nested dictionaries as the main data structore for storing information as required. Name, phone number, email, address and contact notes are stored in the dictionary wth a unique identifer as the outer dctionary key. 

```contact data storage dictionaries
def add_contact():
    try:
        contact_id = input("Enter the contact's unique identifier (phone number or email): ")

        if contact_id in contacts:
            print("A contact with this identifier already exists.")
            return

        name = input("Enter the contact name: ")
        phone = input("Enter the contact phone number: ")
        email = input("Enter the contact email address: ")
        address = input("Enter the contact address: ")
        notes = input("Enter any additional notes: ")

        contacts[contact_id] = {
            'name': name,
            'phone': phone,
            'email': email,
            'address': address,
            'notes': notes
        }
        print(f"{name} added successfully.")

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error! Unable to add contact: {e}")
```

***Menu Actions***
This section requires that all the menu options are defined and work through errors. I struggled a bit with this portion of code because of the formatting. Once I got the right format I began to
